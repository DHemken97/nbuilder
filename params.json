{"body":"### What is it?\r\n\r\nThrough a fluent, extensible interface, NBuilder allows you to rapidly create test data, automatically assigning values to properties and public fields that are of type of the built in .NET data types (e.g. ints and strings). NBuilder allows you to override for properties you are interested in using lambda expressions.\r\n\r\n### Some quick examples\r\n\r\n```\r\nvar products = Builder<Product>.CreateListOfSize(10)\r\n                               .TheFirst(2)\r\n                                   .With(x => x.Title = \"special title\")\r\n                               .Build();\r\n```\r\n## Would give you something like this:\r\n\r\n![Example output 1](http://nbuilder.org/Content/images/example-1-output.gif)\r\n","tagline":"Rapid generation of test objects in .NET","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
